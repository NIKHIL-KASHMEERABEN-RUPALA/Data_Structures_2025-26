Lab 9: Based on pointers & dynamic memory allocation
This lab focuses on the foundational pillars of C programming: Memory Management and Pointer Arithmetic. Understanding these concepts is critical for low-level system design and optimizing performance in high-scale applications.

🎯 Objective of lab - 9 
The primary goal of this lab is to move beyond static memory and understand how to interact directly with the heap and stack using pointers. This is a prerequisite for mastering complex data structures like Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs.
